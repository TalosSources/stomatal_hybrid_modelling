# Questions
* choosing which sites to run in the T&C pipeline
    * specifying them
    * is it okay to choose a subset?
* about precipitation filtering

# Notes
## Next steps
* for now: select a few sites like I did for my project (diverse climatic/biome conditions), aim for 10-15. 
* finish the bash script for iterative calibration
* check everything is running properly (rain filtering, matlab inference)
* make a first run 
-> the goal is to go as quickly as possible towards in-context (T&C) r_s graphs (and other variables)

## Other things to worry about
* make the codebase FRAME-ready
* performance
* complete my analysis of rs_to_Q_LE calls (ideally for that we would use some tool that traces calls and builds a causal tree?)
